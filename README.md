The MorphGNT includes a parsed morphological tagging of the SBL Greek New Testament. 
This work was created by James Tauber as part of his doctorite in linguistics.

#### The SBL Greek New Testament

The Greek Bible App uses SNLGNT as its text:

	With the work of textual criticism far from complete, there is a continual need for fresh research and analysis. 
	The SBLGNT, edited by Michael W. Holmes, utilizes a wide range of printed editions, all the major critical apparatuses, 
	and the latest technical resources and manuscript discoveries to establish the text. 
	
	The result is a critically edited text that differs from the Nestle-Aland/United Bible Societies text in more than 540 variation units.

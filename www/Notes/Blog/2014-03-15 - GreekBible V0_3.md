### Developer Notes

Everything about the app is working well. It is passing all tests and the usability is good.

It will be uploaded for testing to be used for one week prior to the final polishing before the major release.

#### 5 Hour App Thoughts

The 5-Hour App technique promotes high porduction value. However, it is not sufficient to produce a major release in 5 hours. 

Therefore, the 5-hour period will be used as a minor version. Then when then minor versions reach a fully-publishable state, it will be a major version.

Versions previously referred to as V1, V2 should be considered V0.1, V0.2, etc.
